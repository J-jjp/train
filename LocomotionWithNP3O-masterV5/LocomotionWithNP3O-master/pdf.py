Figure 1: Multiplicity of Behavior (MoB) enables a human to tune a single quadruped policy trained
on flat ground to diverse unseen environments. Top row: A low-frequency gait fails to sprint on
slippery terrain (Gait 2; inset) but tuning it to high frequency results in success (Gait 1). However,
a low frequency and high footswing height are necessary for stair traversal (Gait 2; middle image).
A low footswing and wide stance (Gait 3) makes the robot robust to leg shoves, but Gait 1, which
succeeded at sprinting, fails. Tuning gait thus aids in generalizing to different tasks. Bottom row:
Examples of other behaviors enabled by our controller.
